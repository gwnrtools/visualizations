# Gravitational Wave Mode Visualization Toolkit

## Overview

This project is focused on visualizing:
1. **Spherical Harmonics (SH)**
2. **Spin-Weighted Spherical Harmonics (SWSH)**
3. **Gravitational Wave (GW) Modes**

These visualizations are aimed at providing intuitive and detailed representations of various modes and harmonics relevant to gravitational wave astrophysics.

## Acknowledgments

This work has been made possible with the support of **ICTS-TIFR**, under the **Long-Term Visiting Student Program**, mentored by:
- **Prof. Prayush Kumar**
- **Prof. Parameswaran Ajith**
- **Dr. Vaishak Prasad**

## Tools and Usage

The toolkit is housed in the `visualizationtools` directory. Detailed usage examples and testing scripts can be found in the **`test`** folder.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
